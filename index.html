		<br><p> <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2022/5/4/23057830/chinatown-homeless-shelters-canceled-soho-community-board-2"target=blank> Earlier this year,</a> during Mayor Eric Adams first few months in office, several homeless shelters in Manhattan and the Bronx were closed.</p></br>


		<br><p>In an investigation by <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2022/7/26/23279842/homeless-shelters-are-overflowing-and-most-likely-in-poor-areas-despite-fair-share-promises"target=blank>The City</a> in July, it was discovered that homeless shelters are disproportionally being built in majority non-white and poor neighborhoods. Meanwhile, more affluent community districts are putting pressure on the city government to not open homeless shelters in the neighborhood and to cancel existing plans for them.</p></br>

			<br><p>According to The City's investigation, community districts who are given a heavier burden of opening shelters for the homeless are breaking under the pressure, with many of them hitting capacity quickly and being unable to provide for every homeless person in the area.</p></br>
